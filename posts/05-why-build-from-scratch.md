## Why build from scratch?
I've been creating this blog and writing these posts and you might be wondering... why? There are plenty of existing blogging solutions out there. Why re-invent the wheel?

In a way, null.computer is a meta project to keep me coding and growing. I've had blogs in the past, but never stayed motivated enough to keep them updated.

#### This blog is an exploration in coding, computers and all things possible therein.

### :icecream: Exhibit A: Vanilla JS
Checkout the source for this page.

Go ahead, I'll wait. (CTRL+U or CMD+U in Chrome).

You may notice that there is only 1 external library linked. Aside from the [fetch polyfil](https://github.com/github/fetch), everything else is 100% Fair Trade Certified Organic Grade A Hand Crafted DIY Vanilla JavaScript.

I've been challenging myself lately to minimize library usage and stay as vanilla as possible, combined with my desire to keep learning and growing, this blog is an extension of that.

### :tada: Exhibit B: JS is fun
Promises, arrow functions, template literals, array methods (map, filter, reduce), Browser APIs (Service Workers, fetch, etc.) and everything else JavaScript all make coding in JavaScript really fun even without using the latest library/framework.

The JS code for this site is 100% supported in Chrome without any need for transpiling. I'll probably add transpiling soon (damn you older browsers!), but this just speaks to the awesomeness that JS has become.

I will also definitely eventually blog about various interesting libraries and frameworks, but if it can be done in a few lines with Vanilla JS I'll make the effort to do so.

### :1234: Exhibit C: # new posts/# days > ever
I've made more posts in the past 3 days than ever before in my blogging history.

### Final Thoughts
As long as there are things I want to add to this web log (SSL, comments, searching, SEO, SPA, etc. etc. etc.) I'll keep on coding and web logging.

Thanks for reading this far down. Stay tuned for more. :vulcan_salute:
